    "# Methodology for splitting $a$ assets fairly between $n$ people\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rought idea\n",
    "\n",
    "We have $a$ assets and $p$ people. Each assets gets priced individually. By asking people about preferences, we can update the prices, adjusting for group ( average ) preferences and individual preferences. [Sperner's Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperner%27s_lemma) ensures that there will always be a solution where everyone is satisfied with the asset division. The challenge is to minimize the number of questions we ask before we reach an optimal solution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given that we have $n$ people, each question will divide the assets into $n$ groups, and ask the user to choose their favorite asset.\n",
    "2. The group can provide estimates of the original prices ( to speed up finding a solution ).\n",
    "3. We will store our belief of prices as an $a$-dimentional normal distribution.\n",
    "4. With every question, we are drawing a line in the possible values of the prices, and asking the user on which side of the line the true price is. To avoid fully blocking out regions of the $\\mathbb{Z}^a$ plane, we will take the new mean and variance of the now [Truncateed Gaussian Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_normal_distribution), and model our new knowledge as a Gaussian still.\n",
    "5. We model both the average price $X$, and the individual user adjustments $X_i$, such that we have the constraints $\\sum_{i}^{p}X_i = 0$, and user $i$'s preferences are correctly represented by $X+X_i$\n",
    "6. After some iterations we should have a split of the assets in $n$ groups, such that each individual chooses a different group."
