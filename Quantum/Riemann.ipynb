    "3. The equations above describe the heatflow of the Riemann Equation.\n",
    "4. $\\exists Î› \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\forall t \\geq Î›$, we have the zeroes of ${H_t}$ being real. This is known as the [de Bruijnâ€“Newman constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn%E2%80%93Newman_constant).\n",
    "5. $Î› \\geq 0$ was [proved](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05914.pdf) by Brad Rogers & Terence Tau.\n",
    "6. $Î› > 0$ is equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis.\n",
    "7. $Î› \\leq .22$ was [proved](https://github.com/km-git-acc/dbn_upper_bound/blob/master/Writeup/debruijn.pdf) as part of the polimath project.\n",

    "3. Computationally estimate how the $x_i$ evolve backwards in time (i.e. towards $t=0$, getting an estimate of the time $t_k$ at which the trajectories of the various $x_i$ converge to a single point\n",
